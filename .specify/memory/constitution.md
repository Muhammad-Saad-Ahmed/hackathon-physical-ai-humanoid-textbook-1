# Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### Mission
Define that the book teaches Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems. Focus on connecting AI agents with real/simulated humanoid robots.

### Writing Style
Clear, structured, beginner-friendly, technical accuracy, step-by-step, no fluff.

### High-Level Modules
- ROS 2: Core robotics operating system for communication and control.
- Gazebo & Unity: Simulation environments for virtual robot development and testing.
- NVIDIA Isaac: Platform for accelerating robotics development with advanced AI tools.
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA): Systems enabling robots to understand, reason, and act based on visual and linguistic input.

### Required Integrations
- RAG Chatbot: OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, Qdrant, FastAPI, Neon Postgres for interactive learning.
- BetterAuth signup/signin: Secure user authentication.
- Per-chapter personalization button: Tailored learning experience.
- Urdu translation button: Enhanced accessibility.

### Reusable Intelligence
Claude Code Subagents + Skills: High-level, modular AI capabilities for enhanced development and interaction.

### Output Requirements
Must produce /sp.constitution, /sp.specify, /sp.tasks, /sp.deploy. Must deploy the final book using Docusaurus + GitHub Pages.

## Quality Standards

Technical correctness, clarity, automation-friendly, aligned with the humanoid capstone project.

## Key Insights

- Physical AI concept: Bridging digital intelligence with embodied robotics.
- Importance of ROS 2: Foundational framework for modern robotics.
- Simulation necessity: Safe and efficient development environment.
- Strength of NVIDIA Isaac: Accelerating AI-powered robotics.
- Vision-Language-Action as future robotics: Enabling intuitive human-robot interaction.
- Personalization + RAG + Urdu accessibility benefits: Creating an inclusive and effective learning experience.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All content development must verify compliance with these principles.
